lab 5:
Part 1
I made 4 particle systems for the kart and made them flat box emmitters coming from the wheels in world space so they left trails.
Then I attatched some swirlinjg particle systems to the checkpoints that do an extra bunching up flair behavior when you pass through the checkpoint.

a. floor(u*8)
b. abs((floor(v*8))-7)
c. white

The top left cube has a texture and normal map using Three.js, The bottom left cube has just a texture using THREE.js, the middle cube has a texture and normal map using THREE.js, the bottom right cube is textured by the fragment shader in the lab, and the top right is the tiled texture from my fragment shader which I tiled by modding the coordinates by 0.5 to divide each side into 4 textures and then multiplied that by 2 so it would use the whole length of the texture instead of just one half along the x and y axis making it look like just a quarter of the texture in each quadrant.

For the first cube on the left I interpolated between CMYK with my own shaders, second from the left I used the Three.js physical material and made it slightly transparent, the second from the right was made with the Three.js phong material with a green specular highlight and the far right is a simpler color interpolation between blue and pink from the tutorial shader.
