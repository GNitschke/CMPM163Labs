For the first cube on the left I interpolated between CMYK with my own shaders, second from the left I used the Three.js physical material and made it slightly transparent, the second from the right was made with the Three.js phong material with a green specular highlight and the far right is a simpler color interpolation between blue and pink from the tutorial shader.
